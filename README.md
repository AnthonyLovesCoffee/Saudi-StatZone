# Saudi-StatZone
This project is a web application that allows users to check player statistics from the Saudi Pro League. Users can filter stats by names, teams, positions and other criteria. The app will also use a machine learning (ML) model to predict match outcomes, providing insights for football enthusiasts.

## Features
- **Player Stats Scraping**: The app scrapes player statistics from the Saudi Pro League.
- **Filter by Criteria**: Users can filter player stats by team, position, and other relevant factors.
- **Interactive Frontend (Coming Soon)**: A user-friendly web interface will allow users to explore stats and predictions seamlessly.
- **Match Outcome Prediction (Coming Soon)**: A machine learning algorithm will be integrated to predict match outcomes based on player and team statistics.

## Technologies

- **Backend**: Java 21, Spring Boot
- **Data Scraping**: Python3: `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas` 
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 
- **Frontend (TODO)**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning (TODO)**: Scikit-learn/PyTorch/TensorFlow
